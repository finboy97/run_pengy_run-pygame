# About the game

#### Tutorial:

To learn the pygame library, I followed this youtube video up until I got to a point where I was able to play around with what I was doing.

#### Graphics:

The graphics came from a few sources:
1. Royalty free graphics sites. https://piiixl.itch.io/textures
2. https://www.1001fonts.com/gaming-fonts.html
3. And third - I made my own (guess which, it should be fairly obvious!)

#### Sound:

The artists own!
Made using https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker
